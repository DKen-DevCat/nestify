<frontend_aesthetics>
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs.
In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic.
Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than solid colors.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices.
